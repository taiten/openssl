_Description: Which services should be restarted to make them use the new libraries?
 Security holes were fixed with this release. Services may not use these
 fixes until they are restarted. Note: restarting sshd should not affect any
 existing connections.
 .
 Following is a list of detected services that need to be restarted. Please
 correct the list, if you think it is incorrect. The services names must be
 identical to the script names in /etc/init.d and must be separated by
 spaces. If you clear the list, no services will be restarted.
 .
 If other services begin to fail mysteriously after this upgrade, it may be
 necessary to restart them too.  We strongly recommend you to reboot your
 machine to avoid the SSL related trouble.
